Based on the source materials provided, there is **no information** available regarding the lifecycle method of Android apps.

The sources focus exclusively on:
*   Cloud security principles and governance (CIA+A, threats, vulnerabilities, risk).
*   Identity and Access Management (Authentication, Authorization, Active Directory, MFA, PKI).
*   Cloud platform services (Azure Blob Storage resources and static website hosting).
*   Workflow automation concepts and tools (Triggers, Actions, Logic Apps, RPA).

Since the provided material does not cover mobile application development or the specifics of the Android operating system, I cannot draw on the sources to explain the Android app lifecycle.
