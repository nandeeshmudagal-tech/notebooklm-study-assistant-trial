## Exam Flashcards (Q/A Pairs)

| # | Question | Answer | Source Citation |

| **1** | What six primary perspectives or domains of security are typically covered in a comprehensive security framework? | The six domains of security are **Data**, **Application**, **Compute**, **Network** (including Perimeter), **Identity**, and **Physical** security. | |
| **2** | What is the primary functional difference between **Authentication** and **Authorization**? | **Authentication** determines **who you are** ("Do we know you?"). **Authorization** determines **what you can do** ("Now that you have access what are the actions you can perform"?). | |
| **3** | Name the four types of factors commonly required for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). | The four types of MFA factors are **Knowledge** (Something you know), **Possession** (Something you have), **Physical** (Something you are), and **Location** (Where you are). | |
| **4** | According to the source material, define a security "Vulnerability." | A vulnerability is **a weakness that can be exploited** because of insufficient security controls or security controls that have been compromised. This can include configuration deficiencies, user errors, hardware/firmware flaws, or software bugs. | |
| **5** | In Azure Blob storage, what are the three main types of resources that structure the storage environment? | The three types of resources are: 1. **The Storage Account** (a unique namespace). 2. **A Container** (organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory). 3. **A Blob** (the data object, which can be block, append, or page blobs). | |
| **6** | What is Azure Blob storage optimized for storing, and what category of data does this fall under? | Azure Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of **unstructured data**. Unstructured data is data that does not adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data. | |
| **7** | When enabling static website hosting on Azure Blob storage, what are the two required configuration documents that must be specified? | You must specify the **Index document name** (the default page displayed at the root, e.g., `index.html`) and the **Error document path** (the default page displayed for pages that do not exist, e.g., `404.html`). | |
| **8** | Identify the four key components that typically comprise a workflow in a Workflow Automation tool. | The key components are the **Workflow** (sequence of actions/activities), **Triggers** (events that initiate a workflow), **Actions** (tasks executed), and **Connectors** (pre-built integrations for communication between applications and services). | |
| **9** | In Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), if Alice wants to ensure message confidentiality when sending a message to Bob, which key does she use to encrypt the message, and which key does Bob use to decrypt it? | Alice encrypts the message with **Bob's public key**. Bob uses **his private key** to unlock the box and read the message. | |
| **10** | Active Directory provides centralized control over network resources. What organizational components does it use to structure resources and set security laws? | Active Directory uses **Domains**, **OUs** (Organizational Units), **Forests**, and **Trees** for organizational structure. It uses **Group Policy** to set security and configuration settings ("laws") across the network. | |
