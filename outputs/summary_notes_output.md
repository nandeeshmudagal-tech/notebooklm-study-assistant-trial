The core learning encompasses cloud security foundations, data governance, practical cloud storage implementation using Azure, and process automation strategies.

Security is managed across domains (Data, Identity, Network). Identity management involves **Authentication** ("Do we know you?"), supported by **MFA** (Knowledge, Possession, Physical, Location), and **Authorization** ("What you can do?"). Security objectives are measured by ensuring **Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity** (including non-repudiation), and **Availability** (CIA+A). **Risk** management requires assessing the probability of a **Threat** exploiting a **Vulnerability**. **Data Governance** is critical for ensuring data security, accuracy, and privacy across its lifecycle. Mechanisms like **PKI** facilitate secure, confidential communication using public and private key pairs.

**Azure Blob Storage** is optimized for storing vast amounts of **unstructured data**. Its structure consists of a **Storage Account** (unique namespace), **Containers** (like directories), and three types of **Blobs** (Block, Append, Page). Blob storage can be configured to host a **static website** by defining index and error documents.

**Workflow Automation** utilizes tools (like Azure Logic Apps) and low-code environments to optimize and execute processes. A workflow consists of a **Trigger** (initiates the process), **Actions** (tasks executed), and **Connectors** (application integration points). Logic Apps can automate complex tasks, such as creating a workflow to save email attachments directly to Blob Storage containers.
